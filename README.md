# Slimy Hud Augment

A CVR Mod to make the Hud Better !

## Disclaimer

This mod needs a custom HUD to do anything at all. Use [mine](https://github.com/Slime-Senpai/SlimyCVRUI) if you don't know which one to use ;)
(You only need the CVR HUD and the audio files, no need to take the full UI).

## Feature List

- Sound Play for the HUD
- Friendlist is sent to the HUD and can be caught and used

## Installation

Choose BepInEx or MelonLoader version and drag the DLL to the associated mods or plugins folder.

Don't forget to also install a UI that uses this mod or the mod will change nothing !
